botpress-monetize (powered by RadBots)\n\nMonetization plugin for [Botpress](http://github.com/botpress/botpress) (powered by [RadBots](https://radbots.com))\n\n## Installation\nMonetize module can be installed using any of the following way:\n### Installing using the CLI\nFrom CLI, `cd` to the botpress root directory and run:\n``` \nbotpress install monetize\n```\n### Installing using Botpress UI\n\nFrom the botpress UI, you will see a module named **Monetize**. Click the **install** button.\n\n## Get started\n\nTo get started, you need to fill the **Configure RadBots** section directly in the module interface **RadBots**.\n\n<img src=\"/assets/configure_section.png\" alt=\"Configure RadBots\" width=\"500px\" />\n\nSettings can also be set pragmatically by providing the settings in the `${modules_config_dir}/botpress-monetize.json`\n\n### Getting configuration information\n1. Go to https://radbots.com\n2. Create an account / Login if you already have an account\n3. Create an agent (Agent type is **web**)\n4. You will get an **agent key**\n5. Use the **agent key** in the configuration section of RadBots\n6. Navigate to **settings** at the RadBots website\n7. In the **general** tab, we will get the **account key**\n8. Use the **account key** in the configuration section of RadBots\n\n## Usage\n\n### Getting advertise from RadBots\n\nHere we are listening for `get-advertise` key. when we hear that, we call the RadBots api to get an advertise.\n```\nbp.hear('get-advertise', event => {\n\tbp.monetize.getAdvertise().then(ad => {\n\t    // ad is instance of Advertise class \n\t});\n});\n```\n### Getting customized advertise from RadBots\n\nHere we are listening for `get-custom-advertise` key. when we hear that, we call the RadBots api to get an advertise and pass some options to customize the advertise or adding meta values to the advertise you are receiving.\n```\nbp.hear('get-custom-advertise', event => {\n\tbp.monetize.getAdvertise({\n\t    mediaType: <mediaType>,\n\t    context: <context>,\n\t    personaId: <personaId>,\n\t    tags: <tags>,\n\t    intent: <intent>\n\t}).then(ad => {\n\t    // ad is instance of Advertise class \n\t});\n});\n```\n[Learn more about this options at RadBots](https://radbots.com/documentation/developers)\n### Sending advertise\n#### As Button Template for messenger\n\n[What is button template?](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/button-template)\n\nAfter installing the messenger module of Botpress, here we are listening for `get-advertise-as-button-template` key. After getting the advertise, we call `getMessengerButtonTemplate()` method and send it using `sendTemplate()` method of the messenger module.  \n```\nbp.hear('get-advertise-as-button-template', event => {\n\tbp.monetize.getAdvertise().then(ad => {\n\t    bp.messenger.sendTemplate(event.user.id, ad.getMessengerButtonTemplate());\n\t});\n});\n```\n\n\n#### As Generic Template for messenger\n\n[What is generic template?](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/generic-template)\n\nAfter installing the messenger module of Botpress, here we are listening for `get-advertise-as-generic-template` key. After getting the advertise, we call `getMessengerGenericTemplate()` method and send it using `sendTemplate()` method of the messenger module.  \n```\nbp.hear('get-advertise-as-generic-template', event => {\n\tbp.monetize.getAdvertise().then(ad => {\n\t    bp.messenger.sendTemplate(event.user.id, ad.getMessengerGenericTemplate());\n\t});\n});\n```\n\n#### As text message to messenger\nAfter installing the messenger module of Botpress, here we are listening for `get-advertise-as-text` key. After getting the advertise, we call `getRawData()` method which will return raw values that we received from RadBots and send it using `sendText()` method of the messenger module.  \n```\nbp.hear('get-advertise-as-text', event => {\n\tbp.monetize.getAdvertise().then(ad => {\n\t    bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, ad.getRawData().cta_long); // This is the \"Call-to-action\" typically a more in-depth \"about\" regarding the ad.\n\t    bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, ad.getRawData().cta_mini); // This is the \"Call-to-action\" mini, which is a short title for the CTA\n\t    bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, ad.getRawData().url); // This is the location where you'll send people when they click the ad.\n\t});\n});\n```\n**Note:** Make sure to whitelist `www.radbots.com` from the messenger module, otherwise url won't be sent to messenger\n\n#### As image to messenger\nAfter installing the messenger module of Botpress, here we are listening for `get-advertise-as-image` key. After getting the advertise, we call `getRawData()` method which will return raw values that we received from RadBots and send it using `sendAttachment()` method of the messenger module.  \n```\nbp.hear('get-advertise-as-image', event => {\n\tbp.monetize.getAdvertise().then(ad => {\n\t    bp.messenger.sendAttachment(event.user.id, 'image', ad.getRawData().media.url.large);  // large image\n\t    bp.messenger.sendAttachment(event.user.id, 'image', ad.getRawData().media.url.medium); // medium image\n\t    bp.messenger.sendAttachment(event.user.id, 'image', ad.getRawData().media.url.thumb);  // thumbnail image\n\t});\n});\n```\n**Note:** Make sure to whitelist `www.radbots.com` from the messenger module, otherwise image url won't be sent to messenger\n\n## API\n\n### bp.monetize.getAdvertise()\nreturns an `promise` which receives an `Advertise` object on success response.\n```\nbp.monetize.getAdvertise().then(ad => {\n    // ad is instance of Advertise class\n});\n```\n### Params of bp.monetize.getAdvertise()\nAn optional object can be passed to `getAdvertise()` method to customize the advertise or adding meta values to the advertise. The object can have these keys:\n```\n{\n    mediaType: <mediaType>,\n    context: <context>,\n    personaId: <personaId>,\n    tags: <tags>,\n    intent: <intent>\n}\n```\n[Learn more about this options at RadBots](https://radbots.com/documentation/developers)\n### Advertise Object\n#### ad.getMessengerButtonTemplate()\nreturns a button template that can be used for sending button template to messenger.

botpress-hitl\n\nOfficial HITL (Human In The Loop) module for Botpress. This module has been built to easily track and write in your conversation when it's needed. By using this module, you can stop automatic responses of your bot and take control on any conversations.\n\n**Support connectors: ** [botpress-messenger](https://github.com/botpress/botpress-messenger)\n\n## Installation\n\nInstalling modules on Botpress is simple. By using CLI, users only need to type this command in their terminal to add messenger module to their bot.\n\n```js\nbotpress install hitl\n```\n\nThe HITL module should now be available in your bot UI, and the APIs exposed.\n\n## Features\n\n### Viewing conversations\n\nBy using this module, you can look to all your conversations at the same place. You don't have to use external connectors interface to follow your conversations.\n\n<img src='/assets/hitl-screenshot.png' height='300px'>\n\n### Filtering by status\n\nYou can filter conversations based on their status (paused/active) by using filtering button in the UI.\n\n### Pausing/resuming conversations\n\nYou can pause or resume any conversations from the UI.\n\n## API\n\n### `POST /api/botpress-hitl/sessions/{$id}/pause`\n\nPause a specific conversation by using his `id`.\n\n### `POST /api/botpress-hitl/sessions/{$id}/unpause`\n\nResume a conversation for a specific user.\n\n## Example\n\nA basic implementation example that shows how easy it is to implement a help request in Messenger.\n\n```js\n  const _ = require('lodash')\n\n  module.exports = function(bp) {\n    bp.middlewares.load()\n\n    bp.hear(/HITL_START/, (event, next) => {\n      bp.messenger.sendTemplate(event.user.id, {\n        template_type: 'button',\n        text: 'Bot paused, a human will get in touch very soon.',\n        buttons: [{\n          type: 'postback',\n          title: 'Cancel request',\n          payload: 'HITL_STOP'\n        }]\n      })\n\n      bp.notifications.send({\n        message: event.user.first_name + ' wants to talk to a human',\n        level: 'info',\n        url: '/modules/botpress-hitl'\n      })\n      bp.hitl.pause(event.platform, event.user.id)\n    })\n\n    bp.hear(/HITL_STOP/, (event, next) => {\n      bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'Human in the loop disabled. Bot resumed.')\n      bp.hitl.unpause(event.platform, event.user.id)\n    })\n\n    bp.hear({ type: 'message', text: /.+/i }, (event, next) => {\n      bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'You said: ' + event.text)\n    })\n  }\n```\n\n**Note**: This is the only code you need to add to your bot in your `index.js` file.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- Add pause bot in the UI\n- Implement other types of message to view them in UI (template, buttons, etc.)\n\n## Contribution\n\nBotpress Team would really like to have some help from the community to work on this important module.

botpress-wit\n\nThe easiest way to create a Wit.ai bot with Botpress\n\n## Getting started\n\n```\nbotpress install wit\n```\n\nThe Wit.ai module should now be available in your bot UI\n\n## Features\n\nThis module has two modes: **Understanding** (message API) and **Stories** (converse API).\n\n### Understanding\n\nThis mode will inject understanding metadata inside incoming messages through the Wit.ai middleware.\n\nEvents will have a `wit` property populated with the extracted `entities` and the `context`.\n\n**Tip:** Use this mode if you want to handle the conversation flow yourself and only want to extract entities from incoming text. This is great for programmers.\n\n```js\nbp.hear({'wit.entities.intent[0].value': 'weather'}, (event, next) => {\n  console.log('>> Weather')\n  bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'Weather intent')\n})\n```\n\n### Stories\n\nThis mode will run your Wit.ai stories automatically given that you defined the **Actions** in botpress.\n\nFor more information about Actions and how they are run, make sure to read [node-wit](https://github.com/wit-ai/node-wit)'s documentation.\n\n**Tip:** Use this mode if you created a conversation flow on Wit.ai's User Interface and want it to run automatically in your bot. This is great for non-programmers.\n\n#### Example\n\n```js\n// Implement your Actions like this\nbp.wit.actions['getWeather'] = request => {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    bp.logger.info('Get Weather called', request)\n    // Do something here\n    resolve(request.context)\n  })\n}\n\n// You need to call this method once you are done implementing the Actions\nbp.wit.reinitializeClient()\n```\n\n\n## Community\n\nPull requests are welcomed! We believe that it takes all of us to create something big and impactful.\n\nThere's a [Slack community](https://slack.botpress.io) where you are welcome to join us, ask any question and even help others.\n\nGet an invite and join us now! 👉[https://slack.botpress.io](https://slack.botpress.io)\n\n## License\n\nbotpress-wit is licensed under

botpress-rivescript\n\n[RiveScript](https://www.rivescript.com/) is a simple scripting language for chatbots with a friendly, easy to learn syntax.\n\n**botpress-rivescript** implements the RiveScript language as an incoming middleware and adds extra support for executing arbitraty code. Combining the simplicity of RiveScript and the flexibility of Botpress allows people to create very complex and rich dialogs, including sending Cards, Quick Replies, Buttons, Webviews, etc...\n\n**Supported connectors:** [botpress-messenger](https://github.com/botpress/botpress-messenger)\n\n<img src='/assets/screenshot-rivescript.png' height='250px'>\n\n## Get started\n\n```\nbotpress install rivescript\n```\n\nThe rivescript module should now be available in your bot UI, and the APIs exposed.\n\n## Features\n\n### Multi-files\n\nYou can split your dialog into multiple Rive files. By default, two files are provided (`star.rive` and `begin.rive`), as advised by the official [RiveScript documentation](https://www.rivescript.com/docs/tutorial#catch-all-trigger).\n\n### Conversation Simulator\n\nThere's a built-in conversation simulator so that you can test your scripts right from the interface. The simulator also supports `JS Code` execution, including asynchronous invocations.\n\n### Variable Injections\n\n#### User Profiles\n\nIf provided, the content of the `MiddlewareEvent['user']` is injected into the variables.\nFor Facebook, `first_name`, `last_name`, `timezone`, `locale`, `gender`, `avatar_url` are available.\n\n```\n+ what is my name\n- According to your facebook profile, your name is <get first_name> <get last_name>\n```\n\n#### Platform\n\nThe platform is injected in the user variables as the `platform` name.\n\n```\n+ what platform am i using\n- Your talking to me on <get platform>, silly!\n```\n\n### Subroutines\n\n#### <call>wait MS</call>\n\n```\n+ toc toc\n- <call>wait 2000</call>who is there?\n```\n\n### Running JS code in scripts\n\n```\n+ execute\n- JS: console.log(rs, bp, event, send) // all available\n\n+ log\n- JS: bp.logger.info('Hello from RiveScript')\n\n+ quick replies\n- JS: bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'Buy?', { quick_replies: ['Yes', 'No'] })\n```\n\nTo execute your own script, you can register it to `bp` then use it directly in rivescript\n\nIn your index.js\n```js\nbp.hello = (bp, send) => {\n  bp.logger.info('Will send from a custom script !')\n  send('This is a reply !', { quick_replies: ['Yes', 'No'] })\n}\n```\n\nIn your rivescript\n```\n+custom\n- JS: bp.hello(bp, send)\n```\n### UTF-8 Support\n\nYou can enable UTF-8 input parsing by either one of these methods:\n\n- Set the `RIVESCRIPT_UTF8=true` environement variable\n- Call `bp.rivescript.setUtf8(true)` in your bot\n\nRead more about RiveScript and its [UTF8 support here](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js#utf-8-support)\n\n## API\n\n### `GET /api/botpress-rivescript/scripts`\n\nList all the scripting files and their content.\n\n### `POST /api/botpress-rivescript/scripts`\n\nCreate or replace a Rive scripting file. This will automatically trigger an Engine reload.\n\n#### Body\n\n```js\n{\n  name: string, // *required*, the name of the Rive scripting file\n  content: string, // *required*, the full content of the script, must be valid RiveScript language\n  overwrite: boolean // defaults to *false*\n}\n```\n\n#### Response\n\nStatus `200`\n\n### `DEL /api/botpress-rivescript/scripts/:name`\n\nDelete a scripting file. This will automatically trigger an Engine reload.\n\n### `POST /api/botpress-rivescript/simulate`\n\nSimulate an incoming message into the RiveScript engine. **Does not** pass through the middlewares, goes directly to the RiveScript engine. Returns a response.\n\n#### Body\n\n```js\n{\n  text: string // *required*, the text to send to the RiveScript engine\n}\n```\n\n#### Response\n\n```\n\"Hello, Human!\"\n```\n\n### `POST /api/botpress-rivescript/reset`\n\nRestart a conversation from scratch, erasing all variables or previous conversational state.\n\n## Community\n\nPull requests are welcomed!

botpress-webhook\n\nProvides an interface and APIs to manage webhooks to your bot.\n\n## Quick start\n\nFrom the module page you can create and delete platforms. A platform is an http endpoint where you can post to.\n\nFor example you can create a new \"test\" platform.\n\nThe endpoint will be:\n\n> `https://<hostname>:<port>/api/botpress-webhook/webhook/test`\n\nYou can now post to it:\n\n```\ncurl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST -d '{\"payload\":\"value\"}' https://<hostname>:<port>/api/botpress-webhook/webhook/test?text=Cheers&type=curl\n```\n\nAnd an incoming message is sent to be heard:\n\n```js\n{  \n   platform:'test',\n   type:'curl',\n   text:'Cheers',\n   raw:{  \n      payload:'value'\n   }\n}\n```\n\n## Community\n\nThere's a [Slack community](https://slack.botpress.io) where you are welcome to join us, ask any question and even

botpress-broadcast\n\nProvides an interface and APIs to schedule and send messages to your bot audience.\n\n**Support connectors: ** [botpress-messenger](https://github.com/botpress/botpress-messenger)\n\n<img src='/assets/screenshot-broadcast.png' height='300px'>\n\n## Get started\n\n```\nbotpress install broadcast\n```\n\nThe broadcast module should now be available in your bot UI, and the APIs exposed.\n\n## Features\n\n### Send according to Users timezone\n\nYou can decide wether the scheduled time is abolute to the bot's time or to individual users. If no timezone information available for the user, GMT is chosen.\n\n### Send as Javascript snippet\n\nInstead of sending text, you can decide the behavior of the sending function and do basically anything. The function will be called for every message (so for every user).\n\nVariables exposed: \n\n- `bp` botpress instance\n- `userId` the userId to send the message to\n- `platform` the platform on which the user is on\n\nThe built-in Facebook Messenger snippets are example of Javascript execution (see UI).\n\n### Filtering\n\nYou can apply filters to the broadcasts. Filters are small javascript functions that will be evaluated before sending the broadcast to a user. The condition is called for every users the broadcast is scheduled to.\n\nVariables exposed to the filter function:\n- `bp` botpress instance\n- `userId` the userId to send the message to\n- `platform` the platform on which the user is on\n\nThe function needs to return a **boolean** or a **Promise of a boolean**.\n\n**Note:** Starting your function with `return ` is optional.\n\n#### Examples\n\n##### Send a message only to users on Facebook\n\n```js\n[\"platform === 'facebook'\"]\n```\n\n##### Send a message only to subscribed users \n\n**Note**: Assuming your bot has a `subscriptions` table that holds userId and platform\n\n```js\n// in your bot's index.js\n\nbp.isUserSubscribed = (userId, platform) => {\n  return bp.db.get()\n  .then(knex => \n    knex('subscriptions')\n    .where({ userId, platform })\n    .select('count(*) as count')\n    then().get(0).then(({count}) => count > 0)\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```js\n[\"bp.isUserSubscribed(userId)\"]\n```\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- User segmentation\n\n## API\n\n### `GET /api/botpress-broadcast/broadcasts`\n\nReturns a list of the scheduled broadcasts.\n\n### `PUT /api/botpress-broadcast/broadcasts`\n\nSchedules a new broadcast.\n\n#### Body\n\n```js\n{\n  date: string, // *required*, 'YYYY-MM-DD'\n  time: string, // *required*, 'HH:mm'\n  timezone: null|int, // null (users timezone), or integer (absolute timezone)\n  type: string, // *required*, 'text' or 'javascript'\n  content: string // *required*, the text to be sent or the javascript code to execute,\n  filters: [string] // filtering conditions, Javascript code\n}\n```\n\n#### Response\n\n```\n\"Hello, Human!\"\n```\n\n### `POST /api/botpress-broadcast/broadcasts`\n\nUpdate an existing broadcast. Same as PUT except that `id` is also necessary. You can't modify a processing broadcast.\n\n### `DELETE /api/botpress-broadcast/broadcasts/:id`\n\nDelete an existing broadcast. You can't delete a processing broadcast.\n\n## Community\n\nPull requests are welcomed!

botpress-api.ai\nThe easiest way to create an API.AI bot with Botpress\n\n## Getting started\n\n```\nbotpress install api.ai\n```\n\nThe API.AI module should now be available in your bot UI\n\n## Features\n\nThis module has two modes: **Default** (amend incoming events) and **Fulfillment** (respond automatically).\n\n### Default Mode\n\nThis mode will inject understanding metadata inside incoming messages through the API.AI middleware.\n\nEvents will have an `nlp` property populated with the extracted metadata from API.AI.\n\n**Tip:** Use this mode if you want to handle the conversation flow yourself and only want to extract entities from incoming text. This is great for programmers.\n\n```js\nbp.hear({'nlp.action': 'smalltalk.person'}, (event, next) => {\n  bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'My name is James')\n})\n\n// to debug nlp during development\n// this will hear all responses from dialogflow/api.ai\nbp.hear({'nlp.source': 'agent'}, (event, next) => {\n  bp.logger.debug('nlp', event.nlp)\n})\n```\n\n### Fulfillment Mode\n\nThis mode will check if there's an available response in the `fulfillment` property of the API.AI response and respond automatically. No code required.\n\n**Note:** Works only with single-response text. We do not support Cards and quick responses.\n\n**Tip:** This is great for non-programmers or if all your conversation logic is hosted on API.AI.\n\n## Community\n\nPull requests are welcomed! We believe that it takes all of us to create something big and impactful.\n\nThere's a [Slack community](https://slack.botpress.io) where you are welcome to join us, ask any question and even help others.\n\nGet an invite and join us now! 👉[https://slack.botpress.io](https://slack.botpress.io)\n\n## ENV Variables\n\n| ENV | Default | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| BOTPRESS_HTTP_TIMEOUT | 5000 | The timeout to API.AI requests |\n| APIAI_TOKEN | null | Override the API token |\n\n## License\n\nbotpress-api.ai is licensed under

                   GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 19 November 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure\ncooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n","_id":"botpress-messenger@2.2.11","dist":{"shasum":"abb1d782352aaae3efa93d09eb791e3fb7a4585b","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/botpress-messenger/-/botpress-messenger-2.2.11.tgz","fileCount":26,"unpackedSize":5565424},"maintainers":[{"email":"dany.fortin-simard@hotmail.com","name":"danyfs"},{"email":"emirotin@gmail.com","name":"emirotin"},{"email":"k4merton@gmail.com","name":"epaminond"},{"email":"slvn.perron@gmail.com","name":"slvnperron"}],"_npmUser":{"name":"slvnperron","email":"slvn.perron@gmail.com"},"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/botpress-messenger_2.2.11_1519058700556_0.22707313926309625"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"10.0.0":{"name":"botpress-messenger","version":"10.0.0","description":"Official Facebook Messenger connector for botpress","main":"bin/node.bundle.js","homepage":"https://github.com/botpress/botpress-messenger","botpress":{"menuText":"Messenger","menuIcon":"custom","webBundle":"bin/web.bundle.js"},"keywords":["messenger","facebook","botpress","botpress-connector"],"version-manager":{"date":"06/02/2017","warn":"Botpress 1.0 is now available.","botpress-check":">= 0.1","botpress-update":"^1.0","module-downgrade":"~1.0.x"},"scripts":{"test":"echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1","watch":"node webpack.js --watch","compile":"node webpack.js --compile"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/botpress/botpress-messenger.git"},"author":{"name":"Botpress"},"license":"AGPL-3.0","peerDependencies":{"botpress":">= 0.1"},"dependencies":{"bluebird":"^3.4.6","body-parser":"^1.15.2","botpress-version-manager":"^1.0.4","eventemitter2":"^2.1.3","lodash":"^4.16.6","lru-cache":"^4.0.1","node-fetch":"^1.6.3","react-audio-player":"^0.9.0","react-player":"^1.1.2","uuid":"^3.0.0"},"devDependencies":{"babel-core":"^6.26.0","babel-loader":"^7.1.2","babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy":"^1.3.4","babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread":"^6.24.1","babel-preset-latest":"^6.24.1","babel-preset-react":"^6.24.1","babel-preset-stage-0":"^6.24.1","babel-register":"^6.18.0","classnames":"^2.2.5","copy-webpack-plugin":"^4.3.1","css-loader":"^0.28.8","eslint":"^4.17.0","eslint-plugin-react":"^6.7.1","extract-text-webpack-plugin":"^3.0.2","file-loader":"^1.1.6","node-sass":"^3.11.2","raw-loader":"^0.5.1","sass-loader":"^6.0.6","style-loader":"^0.19.1","webpack":"^3.10.0","webpack-node-externals":"^1.6.0"},"readme":"# botpress-messenger\n\n[<img src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/botpress/botpress/7e007114/assets/supports_UMM.png\" height=\"60px\" />](https://botpress.io/docs/foundamentals/umm.html)\n\nOfficial Facebook Messenger connector module for [Botpress](http://github.com/botpress/botpress).\n\nThis module has been build to accelerate and facilitate development of Messenger bots.\n\n## Usage with UMM\n\nThere's 3 supported UMM messages: text, attachments and templates. For doing anything else, please use code (see the other methods supported in `bp.messenger` below).\n\n> **Note on Messenger UMM**\n> \n> All of the Messenger messages support the **`typing`** option. You can specify `true` a number (of milliseconds) or a natural duration string (e.g. `4s`).\n\n#### Sending Text\n##### `content.yml`\n\n```yaml\nwelcome:\n  - Hello, world!\n  - This is a message on Messenger!\n  - text: this works too!\n    typing: 2s\n  - |\n    This is a multi-line\n    message :).\n```\n\n#### Sending Text with [Quick Replies](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/quick-replies)\n\n> **Tip:** We created a shortcut for specifying quick replies and their payloads.\n>\n>> <EXAMPLE_PAYLOAD> This is the text\n>> <.EXAMPLE_PAYLOAD> Text\n> In the latter, starting the payload with a dot (`.`) will prepend the name of the bloc to the postback\n\n##### `content.yml`\n\n```yaml\nwelcome:\n  - text: Hello, world!\n    typing: 250ms\n    quick_replies:\n      - <QR_YES> Yes\n      - <QR_NO> No\n```\n\n##### `content.yml`\n\n```yaml\nwelcome:\n  - text: Hello, world!\n    quick_replies:\n      - <.QR_YES> Yes\n      - <.QR_NO> No\n```\n\nIn this example, the payloads will be `welcome.QR_YES` and `welcome.QR_NO` respectively.\n\n##### `content.yml`\n\n```yaml\nwelcome:\n  - text: Hello, world!\n    quick_replies:\n      - content_type: text\n        title: Yes\n        payload: QR_YES\n      - content_type: text\n        title: No\n        payload: QR_NO\n        image_url: http://petersfantastichats.com/img/green.png\n      - content_type: location\n```\n\n#### Sending [Templates](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/templates)\n\n> **Tip:** We created a shortcut for specifying buttons and their payload (same as quick replies)\n>\n>> <EXAMPLE_PAYLOAD> This is the text\n\n##### `content.yml`\n\n```yaml\nwelcome:\n  - on: facebook\n    template_type: button\n    text: Please click any of the buttons below\n    buttons:\n      - <BTN_RANDOM> Random cat videos\n      - type: postback\n        title: This button gives the same thing\n        payload: BTN_RANDOM\n      - type: web_url\n        url: https://youtube.com/?q=cats\n        title: Cats on Youtube\n```\n\n#### Sending [Attachments](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/attachment-upload)\n\n> **Tip:** We created shortcuts for all the attachment types (see examples)\n\n##### `content.yml`\n\n```yaml\nwelcome:\n  - on: facebook\n    image: https://botpress.io/static/img/nobg_primary_black.png\n  - on: facebook\n    video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIokUU4HAKU\n  - on: facebook\n    attachment: video\n    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIokUU4HAKU\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nInstalling modules on Botpress is simple. By using the CLI, you only need to type this command in your terminal to add the messenger module to your bot.\n\n```\nbotpress install messenger\n```\n\nIt's also possible to install it through the Botpress UI in the modules section.\n\n<img alt='Connexion settings' src='/assets/install-messenger-module.png' width='500px' />\n\n## Get started\n\nTo setup connexion of your chatbot to Messenger, you need to fill the connexion settings directly in the module interface. In fact, you only need to follow these 5 steps and your bot will be active.\n\n<img alt='Connexion settings' src='assets/connexion-settings.png' width='700px'/>\n\nWe **highly recommand** to set your configuration in the `botpress-messenger.config.yml` file that has been automatically created for you, so you won't have any problem to migrate and commit your configuration settings. Settings in this file can (and should) be overwritten by environment variables in production.\n\n> **Tip:** You can also set all the other configs using this configuration file, simply add them and it will override the configuration set in the database.\n\n##### 1. Create a [**Facebook page**](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create) and a [**Messenger application**](https://developers.facebook.com).\n\n<img alt='Create app' src='/assets/create-app-facebook.png' width='500px' />\n\n##### 2. Get App ID and App Secret\nThese information are available on dashboard of developers page. You only need to copy them in module interface.\n\n<img alt='App id' src='/assets/app-id-app-secret.png' width='400px' />\n\n##### 3. Get Access token\nAcces token is available in Messenger section of developers. You need to copy it in the appropriate section of botpress-messenger UI.\n\n<img alt='Acces token' src='/assets/access-token.png' width='500px;' />\n\n##### 4. Setup Hostname\n\nYou need to manually set your **hostname**, here are some you secure tunnels to localhost tools, we suggest you to use for local development:\n\n  - **[pagekite](https://pagekite.net/)** *(highly recommanded, to get a fix url)*\n  - **[localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel)** *(recommanded)*\n  - **[ngrok](https://ngrok.com)** *(recommanded)*\n\nIn production, the hostname is your public server hostname (for example your heroku address).\n\n##### 5. Connect\n\n> **Tip:** To see in details how to configure completly this module, videos are available on our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/botpress)\n\n## Features\n\n### Incoming\n\n* [Profile](#profile)\n* [Text messages](#text-messages)\n* [Postbacks](#postbacks)\n* [Attachments](#attachments)\n* [Referrals](#referrals)\n* [Quick replies](#quick-replies)\n* [Optins](#optins)\n* [Delivery](#delivery)\n* [Read](#read)\n\n### Outgoing\n\n* [Text messages](#text-messages-1)\n* [Attachments](#attachments-1)\n* [Templates](#templates)\n* [Quick replies](#quick-replies-1)\n* [Automatic typing indicator](#automatic-typing-indicator)\n* [Postbacks](#postbacks-1)\n* [Referrals](#referrals-1)\n* [Display Get Started](#display-get-started)\n* [Greeting message](#greeting-message)\n* [Persistent menu](#persistent-menu)\n* [Automatically mark as read](#automatically-mark-as-read)\n* [Composer input disabled](#composer-input-disabled)\n* [Trusted domains](#trusted-domains)\n* [Automatic profile lookup](#automatic-profile-lookup)\n* [Save users in DB](#save-users-in-database)\n* [Webhook security check](#webhook-security-check)\n\n## Reference\n\n### Incoming\n\nYou can listen to incoming event easily with Botpress by using `bp` built-in `hear` function. You only need to listen to specific Messenger event to be able to react to user's actions.\n\n```js\nbp.hear({ platform: 'facebook', type: 'postback', text: 'GET_STARTED' }, (event, next) => {\n      bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'Welcome on Botpress!!!')\n   }\n})\n```\n\nIn fact, this module preprocesses almost all types of message (message, attachment, postback, quick_reply, delivery, read, optin, referrals...) and send them to incoming middlewares. When you build a bot or a module, you can access to all information about incoming messages that have been send to  middlewares.\n\n```js\nbp.middlewares.sendIncoming({\n   platform: 'facebook',\n   type: 'message',\n   user: profile,\n   text: e.message.text,\n   raw: e\n})\n```\n\n#### Profile\n\nYou can acces to all user's profile information by using this module. A cache have been implemented to fetch all information about users and this information is sent to middlewares.\n\n```js\n{\n  id: profile.id,\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  gender: profile.gender,\n  timezone: profile.timezone,\n  locale: profile.locale\n}\n```\n\n**Note**: All new users are automatically saved by this module in Botpress built-in database (`bp.db`).\n\n#### Text messages\n\nAn `event` is sent to middlewares for each incoming text message from Messenger platform with all specific information.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'message',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.message.text,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\nThen, you can listen easily to this `event` in your module or bot\n\n```js\nbp.hear('hello')\n```\n\n#### Postbacks\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'postback',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.postback.payload,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Attachments\n\nThe original attachments messenger event. May contain multiple attachments. Individual attachments are also emmited individually (see Image, Video, File below)\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'attachments',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.message.attachments.length,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n##### Image\n\nIndividual Attachment extracted from the Attachments event.\n\nNote that Stickers, Thumbs Up, GIFs and Pictures are considered images too.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'image', // Same for 'video', 'file' and 'audio'\n  user: profile,\n  text: 'http://www.image.url',\n  raw: { type: 'image', payload: { url: '...' }}\n}\n```\n\n##### Audio\n##### Video\n##### File\n\nSame signature as `Image` above.\n\n#### Referrals\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'referral',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.referral.ref,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Quick Replies\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'quick_reply',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.message.quick_reply.payload,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Optins\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'optin',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.optin.ref,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Delivery\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'delivery',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.delivery.watermark,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Read\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'read',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.read.watermark,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n### Outgoing\n\nBy using our module, you can send anything you want to your users on Messenger. In fact, this module support all types of messages that are available on Facebook (text, images, videos, audios, webviews...).\n\n#### Creating actions without sending them\n\nNote that all the below actions are available under two format: `send___` and `create____`, the latter effectively only creating the middleware Event without sending it to the outgoing middleware. This is useful when combining libraries together (for example Botkit):\n\n```js\n  // This message won't be sent\n  const message = bp.messenger.createText(event.user.id, 'What is your name?')\n  // But `message` is a fully formed middleware event object, ready to be sent\n  // example using the botpress-botkit module\n  convo.ask(message, function(response, convo) { /* ... */ })\n```\n\n### Text messages\n\nIn code, it is simple to send a message text to a specific users ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/text-message)).\n\n#### `sendText(userId, text, [options])` -> Promise\n\n##### Arguments\n\n1. ` userId ` (_String_): Correspond to unique Messenger's recipient identifier. Usually, this `recipient_id` is available from input message.\n\n2. ` text ` (_String_): Text message that will be send to user.\n\n3. ` options ` (_Object_): An object that may contain:\n- `quick_replies` which is an array of quick replies to attach to the message\n- `typing` indicator. true for automatic timing calculation or a number in milliseconds (turns off automatically)\n- `waitDelivery` the returning Promise will resolve only when the message is delivered to the user\n- `waitRead` the returning Promise will resolve only when the user reads the message\n\n##### Returns\n\n(_Promise_): Send to outgoing middlewares a formatted `Object` than contains all information (platform, type, text, raw) about the text message that needs to be sent to Messenger platform. The promise resolves when the message was successfully sent to facebook, except if you set the `waitDelivery` or `waitRead` options.\n\n##### Example\n\n```js\nconst userId = 'USER_ID'\nconst text = \"Select between these two options?\"\nconst options = {\n  quick_replies: [\n    {\n      content_type: \"text\",\n      title: \"Option 1\",\n      payload: \"DEVELOPER_DEFINED_PAYLOAD_FOR_OPTION_1\"\n    },\n    {\n      content_type:\"text\",\n      title:\"Option 2\",\n      payload: \"DEVELOPER_DEFINED_PAYLOAD_FOR_OPTION_2\"\n    }\n  ],\n  typing: true,\n  waitRead: true\n}\n\nbp.messenger.sendText(userId, text, options)\n.then(() => {\n  // the message was read because of `waitRead` option\n})\n```\n\n### Attachments\n\nBy using this function, you can send any type of attachment to your users ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/contenttypes)).\n\n#### `sendAttachment(userId, type, url, [options])` -> Promise\n\n##### Arguments\n\n1. ` userId ` (_String_): Correspond to unique Messenger's recipient identifier\n\n2. ` type ` (_String_): Specific type of  attachment can be `'audio'`, `'file'`, `'image'` or `'video'`\n\n3. ` url ` (_String_): Correspond to specific url of the attachment that need to be sent.\n\n4. ` options ` (_Object_): An object that may contain:\n- `quick_replies`\n- `typing`\n- `waitDelivery` the returning Promise will resolve only when the message is delivered to the user\n- `waitRead` the returning Promise will resolve only when the user reads the message\n\n##### Returns\n\n(_Promise_): Send to outgoing middlewares a formatted `Object` than contains all information (platform, type, text, raw) about the attachment that needs to be sent to Messenger platform.\n\n##### Example\n\n```js\nconst userId = 'USER_ID'\nconst type = 'image'\nconst url = 'https://botpress.io/static/img/nobg_primary_black.png'\n\nbp.messenger.sendAttachment(userId, type, url)\n```\n\n### Templates\n\nBy using this module, it's easy to send any type of supported template to your users ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/templates)).\n\n#### `sendTemplate(userId, payload, [options])` -> Promise\n\n##### Arguments\n\n1. ` userId ` (_String_): Correspond to unique Messenger's recipient identifier\n\n2. ` payload ` (_Object_): Specific `payload` object for your selected template. Actually, many types of template (button, generic, list, receipt...) are supported by Messenger.\n\n3. ` options ` (_Object_): An object that may contains:\n- `typing`\n- `waitDelivery` the returning Promise will resolve only when the message is delivered to the user\n- `waitRead` the returning Promise will resolve only when the user reads the message\n\n##### Returns\n\n(_Promise_): Send to outgoing middlewares a formatted `Object` than contains all information (platform, type, text, raw) about the template that needs to be sent.\n\n##### Example\n\n```js\nconst userId = 'USER_ID'\nconst payload = {\n    template_type: \"button\",\n    text: \"Have you seen our awesome website?\",\n    buttons: [\n        {\n            type: \"web_url\",\n            url: \"https://www.botpress.io\",\n            title: \"Show Website\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nbp.messenger.sendTemplate(userId, payload, { typing: 2000 })\n```\n\n#### Quick replies\nBy using `options` argument, you can easily add quick replies to text messages or attachments.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n    quick_replies: [\n        {\n            content_type :\"text\",\n            title: \"Option\",\n            payload: \"DEVELOPER_DEFINED_PAYLOAD_FOR_OPTION\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Automatic typing indicator\n\nAs quick replies, you can add an automatic typing indicator to your messages by adding `typing` to `options` argument.\n\n```js\nconst options = { typing: true }\n```\n\n\n#### Postbacks\n\nThis module support postbacks. Postbacks occur when a Postback button, Get Started button, Persistent menu or Structured Message is tapped ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference/postback)).\n\n#### Referrals\n\nThis module also support referrals. In fact, the value of the `ref` parameter is passed by the server via webhook and we are able to access these referrals in parameters of input messages ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference/referral)).\n\n#### Display Get Started\n\nTo active get started button on Messenger, users can modify display setting directly in user interface ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/get-started-button)).\n\n<img alt='Get started button' src='/assets/display-get-started.png' width='600px' />\n\n\n#### Greeting message\n\nDirectly in module view, users are able to modify greeting message ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/greeting-text)).\n\n\n<img alt='Greeting message' src='/assets/greeting-message.png' width='600px' />\n\n#### Persistent menu\n\nUsers can directly modify persistent menu in module user interface. By using UI, it's possible to add, modify and remove items \\([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/persistent-menu)\\).\n\n<img alt='Persistent menu' src='/assets/persistent-menu.png' width='600px' />\n\n#### Automatically mark as read\n\nDirectly in UI, users can setup if they want to automatically mark all messages as read ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference/message-read)).\n\n<img alt='Mark as read' src='/assets/automatically-mark-as-read.png' width='600px' />\n\n#### Composer input disabled\n\nDirectly in UI, users can setup if they want to deactivate or not the user input ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/persistent-menu)).\n\n#### Trusted domains\n\nBy using UI, users can configure \\(add, modify and remove\\) trusted domains ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/domain-whitelisting)).\n\n<img alt='Trusted domains' src='/assets/trusted-domains.png' width='600px'/>\n\n#### Chat Extensions\n\nUsing the UI, you can set the home URL for your chat extension ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/chat-extensions)).\n\n**Note:** the URL you specify must use HTTPS.  Facebook will return an error if you enter an URL that is not using HTTPS.\n\n<img alt=\"Chat Extensions\" src='/assets/chat-extensions.png' width='600px'/>\n\nChat extensions supports the following configuration options:\n  - *Update Home URL*: the url that hosts your chat extension.  You can remove the URL by leaving the box blank.\n  - *Show Share Button*: if checked, this will show a Facebook share button in the header of your webview.\n  - *In Test*: if checked, your chat extension is in test mode and is only viewable by people associated with your Messenger app in the developer console.  Uncheck this box when you want your chat extension to be viewable to the general public\n\n#### Payment Testers\nUsing the UI, you can assign users to be [\"Payment Testers.\"](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/payment#payment_test_users)\n\nIn order for this to work, the user must be a registered admin, developer or test user through your Facebook developer console and they must have initiated conversation with your bot.  You cannot just add any user to be a payment tester.  It is also important to note that this is the *only* way to run a test payment with [Messenger Extensions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webview).\n\n<img alt=\"Payment Testers\" src='/assets/payment_testers.png' width='600px'/>\n\nWhen adding a new user, you can start typing their name into the box.  This will pull up a list of matching users who have been communicating with your bot.  The value in the parentheses is the page-scoped user ID for that user.\n\n#### Automatic profile lookup\n\nProfiles are automatically lookedup using Facebook Graph API. The profile of the user can be found in the incoming middleware events: `event.user`\n\nThe following properties are available: first_name, last_name, locale, gender, timezone.\n\n#### Save users in Database\n\nUsers are automatically persisted in the built-in botpress database using the built-in `bp.db.saveUser` function.\n\n#### Webhook security check\n\nbotpress-messenger verifies that requests really come from Facebook's servers by validating requests hash.\n\n## Example\n\n* Botpress examples \\(soon\\).\n* Youtube Channel \\(soon\\).\n\n### Community\n\nThere's a [Slack

botpress-dialog\n\nOfficial Dialog module for [Botpress](http://github.com/botpress/botpress). Uses [dialog-node](https://github.com/dialoganalytics/dialog-node) behind the scenes.\n\n[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/badges/github.com/dialoganalytics/botpress-dialog.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/github.com/dialoganalytics/botpress-dialog)\n[![NPM Version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/botpress-dialog.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/botpress-dialog)\n\n## Examples\n\n- [Botpress application with Messenger and Dialog modules](https://github.com/dialoganalytics/botpress-example)\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ botpress install dialog\n```\n\n## Get Started\n\nConfigure the module with your Dialog API token which is available in your [personal account](http://app.dialoganalytics.com/users/edit), and a bot ID.\n\n<img alt='Configuration' src='/assets/configuration-screenshot.png' width='500px;' />\n\nConfiguration can also be done programmatically by providing the settings in the file `${modules_config_dir}/botpress-dialog.json`.\n\n**Note:** Please note this currently only works with [botpress-messenger](https://github.com/botpress/botpress-messenger)\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce the module is installed and configured, every incoming and outgoing messages will be tracked by Dialog.\n\n### Advanced\n\nAdvanced instrumentation is exposed via the `bp.dialog` object. The following methods are available:\n\n#### Events\n\nSend events to Dialog to keep track of your custom logic. Optionally pass an Interlocutor's distinct id to tie the event to one of your bot's interlocutors. See [docs.dialoganalytics.com/reference/event#create](https://docs.dialoganalytics.com/reference/event#create)\n\n```js\nbp.dialog.event('subscribed', 'interlocutorDistinctId', { custom: 'value' })\n```\n\n#### Clicks\n\nRecord clicks by interlocutors inside a conversation using a trackable link. For every links that needs to be tracked, generate a trackable URL by passing the interlocutor's distinct Id (provided by the platform or provider) and the `url` to the `link` method. See [docs.dialoganalytics.com/reference/click-tracking](https://docs.dialoganalytics.com/reference/click-tracking/)\n\n```js\nbp.dialog.link('http://example.com', interlocutorDistinctId)\n// https://api.dialoganalytics.com/v1/b/7928374/clicks/?id=123456&url=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com\n```\n\n#### Attach\n\nModify the current `track` payload about to be sent to Dialog's API with this helper method.\n\nFor example, you can specify a message name:\n\n```js\nbp.dialog.attach('welcome')\nbp.dialog.attach({ message: { name: 'welcome' }}) // equivalent\n```\n\nThis will modify the `track` payload:\n\n```js\n{\n  message: {\n    name: \"welcome\",\n    ...\n  },\n  conversation: { ... },\n  creator: { ... }\n}\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"pdionne","email":"dionne.phil@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-02-23T19:07:07.587Z","created":"2016-12-21T22:44:20.129Z","1.0.0":"2016-12-21T22:44:20.129Z","1.0.1":"2016-12-21T23:05:42.123Z","1.0.2":"2016-12-21T23:20:46.103Z","1.0.3":"2017-01-04T20:16:48.446Z","1.0.4":"2017-01-06T16:22:58.983Z","1.0.5":"2017-01-09T20:27:16.678Z","1.0.6":"2017-01-10T20:45:43.617Z","1.0.7":"2017-01-17T16:37:52.136Z","1.0.8":"2017-01-18T14:52:37.597Z","1.0.9":"2017-01-19T16:26:35.419Z","1.0.10":"2017-01-19T16:32:09.194Z","1.0.11":"2017-01-20T21:49:10.385Z","1.0.12":"2017-01-21T18:30:25.613Z","1.0.13":"2017-01-31T22:11:16.728Z","1.0.14":"2017-01-31T23:21:15.126Z","1.0.15":"2017-02-22T15:35:21.800Z","1.0.16":"2017-02-23T19:02:36.460Z","1.0.17":"2017-02-23T19:07:07.587Z"},"author":{"name":"Philippe

botpress-slack\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/botpress/botpress/7e007114/assets/supports_UMM.png\" height=\"60px\" />\n\nOfficial Slack connector module for [Botpress](http://github.com/botpress/botpress).\n\nThis module has been built to accelerate and facilitate development of Slack bots.\n\n## Usage with UMM\n\nThere's 3 supported UMM messages: text, attachments and reactions. For doing anything else, please use code (see the other methods supported in `bp.slack` below).\n\n> **Note on Slack UMM**\n> \n> All of the Slack messages below support an optional **`option`** field which accepts any extra arguments as per the ([slack doc](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage)) about **chat.postMessage**.\n\n#### Sending Text\n##### `content.yml`\n\n```yaml\nwelcome:\n  - Hello, world!\n  - This is a message on Slack!\n  - text: this works too!\n  - |\n    This is a multi-line\n    message :).\n```\n\n#### Sending a single [Attachment](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments)\n##### `content.yml`\n\n```yaml\nwelcome:\n  - on: slack\n    attachment:\n      title: The Further Adventures of Slackbot\n      fields:\n        - title: Volume\n          value: 1\n          short: true\n        - title: Issue\n          value: 3\n          short: true\n      author_name: Stanford S. Strickland\n      author_icon: https://a.slack-edge.com/bfaba/img/api/homepage_custom_integrations-2x.png\n      image_url: http://i.imgur.com/OJkaVOI.jpg?1\n```\n\n#### Sending a multiple [Attachments](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments)\n##### `content.yml`\n\n```yaml\nwelcome:\n  - on: slack\n    attachments:\n\n      - title: The Further Adventures of Slackbot\n        fields:\n          - title: Volume\n            value: 1\n            short: true\n          - title: Issue\n            value: 3\n            short: true\n        author_name: Stanford S.

By using CLI, users only need to type this command in their terminal to add slack module to their bot.\n\n```js\nbotpress install slack\n```\n\nIt's also possible to install it through the Botpress UI in the modules section.\n\n## Get started\n\nTo setup connexion of your chatbot to Slack, you need to fill the connexion settings directly in the module interface. In fact, you only need to follow these steps and your bot will be ready to use.\n\nSettings can also be set programmatically by providing the settings in the `${modules_config_dir}/botpress-slack.json`\n\n<img alt='Connexion settings' src='assets/connexion-settings.png' width='700px'/>\n\n#### 1. Setup Hostname\n\nYou need to manually enter your hostname. If you are developping locally, we suggest using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to deploy your chatbot ([learn more about ngrok](https://ngrok.com)\n\n#### 2. Create a [**Slack app**](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1)\n  \n<img alt='Create app' src='/assets/create-app-slack.png' width='450px' />\n\n#### 3. Get Client ID and Client Secret\n\nThese information are available on **Basic Information** of you app. You only need to copy them in module interface.\n\n<img alt='Client id and client secret' src='/assets/client-id-client-secret.png' width='500px' />\n\n#### 4. Setup OAuth & Permissions\n\nOn the **OAuth & Permissions** page of your slack app, you need to enter your redirect url for the authentification. The redirect url need to be `${hostname}/modules/botpress-slack` as you can see in the example screenshot below.\n\n<img alt='OAuth settings' src='/assets/oauth.png' width='500px;' />\n\n#### 5. Create a Bot User\n\nOn the **Bot Users** page of your slack app, you need to add a Bot User by clicking on **Add a Bot User**. We suggest you to turn on **Always Show My Bot as Online** for be able to use RTM API correctly.\n\n<img alt='Bot users' src='/assets/bot-user.png' width='500px;' />\n\n#### 6. Setup Interactive Messages\n\nOn the **Interactive messages** page of your slack app, you need to **Enable Interactive Messages** and add a **Request URL**. The URL entered needs to be format as `${hostname}/api/botpress-slack/action-endpoint`.\n\n<img alt='Interactive messages' src='/assets/interactive-messages.png' width='500px;' />\n\n#### 7. Get Verification Token\n\nThe verification token should appear below App Id and App  information are available on **Basic Information** of you app. You only need to copy them in module interface.\n\n<img alt='App id and app secret' src='/assets/verification-token.png' width='500px' />\n\n#### 8. Set scope\n\nOn your configuration page of your module, you need to set scope of your bot. We suggest you to keep the default configuration (**admin,bot,chat:write:bot,commands,identify,incoming-webhook**), but if you want to want to modify it, we suggest you to look to the [documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-scopes).\n\n#### 9. Authenticate & Connect\n\nNext step is to authenticate and connect your bot. To do it, you only need to click on **Authenticate & Connect** on your module and follow the steps. Once it will be done, you should received an **API Token** and a **Bot Token**. They will appear on your settings page of your module.\n\n<img alt='Connexion completed' src='/assets/completed.png' width='500px;' />\n\nIf you want to have more information about documentation, options and API, we suggest you to look at the [official slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/).\n\n## Features\n\n### Incoming\n\n* [Profile](#profile)\n* [Text](#text)\n* [Reaction](#reaction)\n* [Typing](#typing)\n* [File](#file)\n* [User mention](#user-mention)\n* [Bot mention](#bot-mention)\n* [Others](#others)\n* [Direct message](#direct-message)\n* [Validation](#validation)\n\n### Outgoing\n\n* [Text](#text)\n* [Attachments](#attachments)\n* [Reaction](#reaction)\n* [Update text](#update-text)\n* [Update attachments](#update-attachments)\n* [Delete text or attachments](#delete-text-or-attachments)\n* [Remove reaction](#remove-reaction)\n\n### API\n\n* Status\n* User\n* Users\n* Channels\n* Team\n* Data\n\n## Reference\n\n### Incoming\n\nYou can listen to incoming event easily with Botpress by using `bp` built-in `hear` function. You only need to listen to specific Slack event to be able to react to user's actions.\n\n```js\nbp.hear({ platform: 'slack', type: 'message', text: 'Hello' }, (event, next) => {\n\tbp.slack.sendText(event.channel.id, 'Welcome on Botpress!!!')\n})\n```\n\nIn fact, this module preprocesses almost all types of message (message, reaction, attachments, file, typing...) and send them to incoming middlewares. When you build a bot or a module, you can access to all information about incoming messages that have been send to  middlewares.\n\n```js\nbp.middlewares.sendIncoming({\n\tplatform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'message',\n\ttext: 'Text message here... (e.g. Hello world)'\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n})\n```\n\n#### Profile\n\nYou can acces to all user's profile information (`event.user`) by using this module. A cache have been implemented to fetch all information about users and this information is sent to middlewares.\n\n```js\n{\n  \"id\": \"U023BECGF\",\n  \"team_id\": \"T021F9ZE2\",\n  \"name\": \"bobby\",\n  \"deleted\": false,\n  \"status\": null,\n  \"color\": \"9f69e7\",\n  \"real_name\": \"Bobby Tables\",\n  \"tz\": \"America\\/Los_Angeles\",\n  \"tz_label\": \"Pacific Daylight Time\",\n  \"tz_offset\": -25200,\n  \"profile\": {\n      \"avatar_hash\": \"ge3b51ca72de\",\n      \"first_name\": \"Bobby\",\n      \"last_name\": \"Tables\",\n      \"real_name\": \"Bobby Tables\",\n      \"email\": \"bobby@slack.com\",\n      \"skype\": \"my-skype-name\",\n      \"phone\": \"+1 (123) 456 7890\",\n      \"image_24\": \"https:\\/\\/...\",\n      \"image_32\": \"https:\\/\\/...\",\n      \"image_48\": \"https:\\/\\/...\",\n      \"image_72\": \"https:\\/\\/...\",\n      \"image_192\": \"https:\\/\\/...\"\n  },\n  \"is_admin\": true,\n  \"is_owner\": true,\n  \"has_2fa\": false\n}\n```\n\n**Note**: All new users are automatically saved by this module in Botpress built-in database (`bp.db`).\n\n#### Text\n\nAn `event` is sent to middlewares for each incoming text message from Slack platform with all specific information.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'message',\n\ttext: 'Text message here... (e.g. Hello world)',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\nThen, you can listen easily to this `event` in your module or bot\n\n```js\nbp.hear('hello')\n```\n\n#### Reaction\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'reaction',\n\ttext: 'Dany Fortin-Simard reacted using wink',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\treaction: 'wink',\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### Typing\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'typing',\n\ttext: 'Sylvain Perron is typing',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### File\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'file',\n\ttext: 'Justin Watson shared a file',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tfile: [Object],\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### User mentioned\n\nUser mentioned is sent each time a user mentions another user in a message.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'user_mentioned',\n\ttext: 'User has been mentioned',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tmentionedId: 'U41H4NB9N',\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### Bot mentioned\n\nBot mentioned is sent to incoming middlewares when your bot is mentioned in a message.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'bot_mentioned',\n\ttext: 'Bot has been mentioned',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tmentionedId: 'U41H4NB9N',\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### Other\n\nSlack connector also receives all other events that come from Real Time Messaging API. You can look at the [documentation](https://api.slack.com/rtm) to have more information about some specific event. \n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'other_types',\n\ttext: 'An another type of event occured',\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### Direct message\n\nAs you can see in all incoming events, we added a particular field `direct` to differentiate message that comes from channel or direct.\n\n```\n{\n\tdirect: false\n}\n```\n\n#### Validation\n\nThis module also comes with some validation to be certain that events are coming from Slack API. For that, each incoming event are validated using your verification token.\n\n### Outgoing\n\nBy using our module, you can send anything you want to your users on Slack. In fact, this module support most important types of messenge that are available on Slack (text, attachments, button, reaction).\n\n#### Creating actions without sending them\n\nNote that all the below actions are available under two format: `send___` and `create____`, the latter effectively only creating the middleware Event without piping (sending) it to the outgoing middleware. This is useful when combining libraries together (for example Botkit):\n\n```js\n  // This message won't be sent\n  const message = bp.slack.createText(event.channel.id, 'What is your name?')\n  // But `message` is a fully formed middleware event object, ready to be sent\n  // example using the botpress-botkit module\n  convo.ask(message, function(response, convo) { /* ... */ })\n```\n\n### Text\n\nIn code, it is simple to send a message text to a specific channel ([slack doc](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage)).\n\n#### `sendText(channel, text, [options])` -> Promise\n\n##### Arguments\n\n1. ` channelId ` (_String_): Correspond to unique Channel's recipient identifier. Usually, this `channelId` is available from input message.\n\n2. ` text ` (_String_): Text message that will be send to channel.\n\n3. ` options ` (_Object_): An object that may contain possible options for normal `chat.postMessage` (see [documentation](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) for more details)\n\n##### Returns\n\n(_Promise_): Send to outgoing middlewares a formatted `Object` than contains all information (platform, type, text, raw) about the text message that needs to be sent to Slack platform. The promise resolves when the message was successfully sent to slack.\n\n##### Example\n\n```js\nbp.hear({ platform: 'slack', text: 'Hello'}, event => {\n\tconst channelId = event.channel.id\n\tconst text = 'Hello human!'\n\n\tbp.slack.sendText(channelId, text)\n\t.then(() => {\n\t\t//Do something else\n\t})\n})\n\n```\n\n### [Attachments](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments)\n\nBy using this function, you can send any type of attachment to your users ([slack doc](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-formatting).

botpress-discord\n\n## Installation\n\nInstalling modules on Botpress is simple. By using the CLI, you only need to type this command in your terminal to add the discord module to your bot.\n```\nbotpress install discord\n```\n\nIt's also possible to install it though the Botpress UI in the modules section. (probably)\n\n## Get started\n\n##### 1. Create a [**new Discord app**](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)\n<img alt=\"Create app\" src=\"/assets/create-app-discord.png\" width=\"500px\" />\n\n#### 2. Add a bot user to your app\nJust press the \"Add bot user button\"\n\n#### 3. Copy the newly generated token\n\n#### 4. Insert the token into the config\nThe config is located at _modules_config/botpress-discord.json_. Insert the token as string at the key \"botToken\".\n\n#### 5. ????\n#### 6. Profit!\n\n## Features\n\n### Incoming\n\n* [Text messages](#text-messages)\n\n### Outgoing\n\n* [Text messages](#text-messages-1)\n* [Attachments](#attachments)\n* [Images](#images)\n\n## Reference\n\n### Incoming\n\nYou can listen to incoming events easily with Botpress by using the built-in \"hear\" function.\n\n##### Ready\n```js\nbp.hear({platform: \"discord\", type: \"ready\"}, (event) => {\n\tlet client = event.discord;\n})\n```\n\n##### Messages\n```js\nbp.hear({platform: \"discord\", type: \"message\", text: /^hello/i}, event => {\n\tbp.discord.sendText(event.channel.id, \"Welcome!\")\n})\n```\n\n##### User status update\n```js\nbp.hear({platform: \"discord\", type: \"status\"}, (event) => {\n\tlet user = event.user,\n\t\tstatus = event.status,\n\t\tgame = event.game;\n});\n```\n\n##### User typing\n```js\nbp.hear({platform: \"discord\", type: \"typing\"}, (event) => {\n\tlet user = event.user,\n\t\tchannelID = event.channelID;\n});\n```\n\n#### Text messages\nAn `event` is sent to middlewares for each incoming text message from Discord.\n```js\n{\n  platform: \"discord\",\n  type: \"text\",\n  user: e.author,\n  text: e.content,\n  channel: e.channel,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n### Outgoing\n\n#### Text messages\n```js\nbp.discord.sendText(channelId, text)\n```\n\n###### You can also pass extra params to this method (check out [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris) documentation):\n\n```js\nbp.discord.sendText( event.channel.id, \"Welcome!\", { 'embed': {\n\ttitle: \"I'm an embed!\",\n\tdescription: \"Here is some more info, with **awesome** formatting.\\nPretty *neat*, huh?\",\n}});\n```\n\n#### Attachments\n```js\nbp.discord.sendAttachment(channelId, description, uri)\n```\n\n#### Images\n```js\nbp.discord.sendImage(channelId, uri)\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"pako_","email":"paul@niobium.me"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-06-12T20:57:23.313Z","created":"2017-02-18T21:12:44.722Z","1.0.0":"2017-02-18T21:12:44.722Z","1.0.1":"2017-02-19T12:49:02.938Z","1.0.2":"2017-02-19T13:14:11.568Z","1.0.3":"2017-02-19T13:17:48.562Z","1.0.4":"2017-02-21T20:48:06.058Z","2.0.0":"2017-03-02T16:26:56.014Z","2.0.1":"2017-03-13T10:22:20.538Z","2.0.2":"2017-03-14T20:36:09.593Z","2.0.3":"2017-03-14T20:42:26.981Z","2.0.4":"2017-03-14T20:55:22.618Z","2.0.5":"2017-03-15T16:43:22.418Z","2.0.6":"2017-03-15T18:46:05.330Z","2.0.7":"2017-03-15T18:51:13.445Z","2.0.8":"2017-03-15T18:55:16.424Z","2.0.9":"2017-03-15T19:05:54.065Z","2.1.0":"2017-06-12T20:57:23.313Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/TheFreakLord/botpress-discord#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+ssh://git@github.com/TheFreakLord/botpress-discord.git"},"author":{"name":"Paul
